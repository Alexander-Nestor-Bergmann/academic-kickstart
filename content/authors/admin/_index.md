I am a Herchel Smith Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge. In short, my main interests lie in biomechanics. I use mixture of mathematical modelling and computational simulations to derive a physical understanding of biological systems. A fundamental aspect of this work is extensive interaction between “wet” and “dry” biologists.
